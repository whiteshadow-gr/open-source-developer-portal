# **1.** About us

We are a private limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 09821157and have our registered office at The Cottages, 8 Comberton Road, Barton, Cambridge, CB23 7BA.

# **2.** About HAT Accounts

A &quot;**HAT Account&quot;** is a private micro-server account that can be used to collect, store and ultimately control data.  You can claim your data from multiple sources and then view, manage and decide how the data will be used and potentially shared. You can also use a HAT Account as a type of universal user account to control other applications and services that are HAT enabled.

When operating your HAT Account, you interact with the HATDeX Platform. In doing so, you must comply with the HAT Acceptable Use Policy [[http://www.hatdex.org/acceptable-use-policy/](http://www.hatdex.org/acceptable-use-policy/)].

# **3.** Security and other matters affecting your use of your HAT Account

We are neither a data controller nor a data processor for purposes of data protection law. We simply enable you to claim, hold and share your data.

It is your responsibility to (a) protect against unauthorised access to your HAT Account, (b) not share and otherwise ensure no-one else uses your HAT Account, (c) keep your password or other access information secret (your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access), and (d) generally maintain good internet security.

If the email account you give us is compromised this could allow access to your HAT Account by third parties. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your HAT Account. If you think that your email account has been compromised you should change your HAT Account credentials, and in particular make sure your compromised email account does not allow access to your HAT Account. You should also tell us as soon as possible after you become aware of this, so that we can try to help you keep your HAT Account secure and, if necessary, warn anyone else using the HATDeX Platform who could be affected.

### Data Plugs

A Data Plug is a service that enables you to authorise the transfer of your data from a third party platform to your HAT Account.  You agree that you will only authorise a Data Plug when you are not prohibited under this Owner Agreement or any applicable law from obtaining the data concerned. We reserve the right not to authorise or to cancel any Data Plug for which you have not the right to obtain the data or that is in violation of the Terms or any applicable law. You can decide to interrupt a Data Plug at any time. The Data Plug will stop obtaining and transferring the data concerned as soon as you interrupt the Data Plug.

### Sharing your data

You may also be able to share the data contained in your HAT account with your friends and family who have a HAT account on a &#39;T HAT to HAT basis&#39;.

Please think carefully about what you share because once it has been transferred you will no longer have control of the data.

# **4.** Rules applying to HAT Owner Services

We make available to you various Owner Services (the &quot;HAT Owner Services&quot;), compatible with different computer Operating Systems, to enable you to manage your HAT Account.  Some of the HAT Owner Services are also made available as an open source programme for others to build on.

Owner Services are web or mobile applications that allow the HAT owner to view the data in their HAT account. Except for performance improvements, Owner Services do not store any HAT personal data.

HAT Owner Services extensions are additional software, developed by us or third parties, that can modify and/or enhance the functionality of the HAT Dashboards (the &quot;Extensions&quot;).  Extensions may require the collection and processing of your personal and browsing data. You agree that we may, without notice, look for available updates to Extensions, download them and install them automatically.  We reserve the right to disable or remove Extensions that do not comply with the Terms or any applicable law.

# **5.** Rules applying to Data Debits

A Data Debit is an extraction of data from a HAT Account, with consent from the HAT Owner.  For more information on Data Debits, check ( [https://developers.hubofallthings.com/guides/data-debits/](https://developers.hubofallthings.com/guides/data-debits/))

### Data Acquirers and Data Offers

A **Data Acquirer** is a corporation, company, partnership, LLP or any other incorporated entity or sole trader acting in a business capacity.  Data Acquirers can make **Data Debit Requests** that set out the terms on which the Data Acquirer is willing to acquire access to your data in return for cash or other benefits.

When you agree to a Data Debit Request, you expressly authorise us to share the data for which the request is made with the Data Acquirer issuing the Data Debit request. We will only share your data with the third party issuing the request. When cash is being paid, we will credit the price paid by the Data Acquirer on your payment instrument within [5] working days from the date of acceptance (subject to any terms set by the Data Acquirer about a minimum number of participants being satisfied).

### Applications

We also make various applications (or &quot;apps&quot;) available on the HATDeX Platform.  Such applications are licensed and not sold to you and your licence to use the application will be dependent on your acceptance of additional terms (including in some instances payment terms) contained in an End User Licence Agreement that you will need to accept before using the application.
